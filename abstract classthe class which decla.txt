     //1.Override the abstract method
     //2.make the class as abtract

//3.can abstract methods be private ,static ,final?
     //NO
     //the goal of having abstract methods is to override , 
      //if abtract method is private,static & final we cannot override,theerefore abstract methods  accnot be private ,statoc & final
